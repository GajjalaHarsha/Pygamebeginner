			1.left to right in top of screen
			2.left to right in bottom of screen
			3.top to bottom in left side of screen
			4.top to bottom in right side of screen
			5.diagonal from left to right of screen
			6.diagonal from right to left of screen

2. Traffic signal- i have created two buttons 1.go    -> when we click it, it switches from yellow to greeen light
					      2. stop -> when we click it, it switches from yellow to red light

3. TicTacToe - I have implemented this by displaying the person name as winner of Tic Tac Toe. I have created other one, by using person starting letter in game instead of '*' OR 'O'

4.Pong game - Instead of using 2 users i have used only one paddle and ball
